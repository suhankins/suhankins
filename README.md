> Oh, I could be a **canvas**, I could be a **doll**</br>
I don't think I'm even something **real at all**</br>
I could be a **woman**, I could be a **man**</br>
Look into the mirror, **tell me what I am**</br>
Oh, I could be a **difference**, I could be **the same**</br>
Try to **give me meaning**, it's a losing game</br>
I could go to **heaven**, I could go to **hell**</br>
Does it even matter? **I could never tell**</br>
Oh, maybe I am **nothing**, maybe I am **all**</br>
Baby, **make me something** 'fore I get that call
